Get your starter good and strong, use yeast water to boost it if you can make some.

Fiona's Basic gluten free bread instructions

A few secrets :
You need a balance of starchy and non starchy flours (30:70 ish) otherwise, it doesn't really matter, it depends on taste.
You need a binder to hold the dough/bread together - I use psyllium husk
You make a batter rather than a dough, just mix it up and put it into a tin then let sit overnight to proof.
Whipped egg whites folded in at the end help with texture, lightness and rise.

Step one : make a starter using gluten free flour of your choice, I used a supermarket blend but apparently brown rice flour is best. I have recently discovered that making a wild yeast water is actually a lot easier to get a starter going than flour and water but that's another story.

Step two: at night, mix -
12g psyllium husk
400g water
150g starter
Enough flour to make a batter - this depends on the flour, some soak it up, others are more watery, it doesn't matter, just keep adding, mixing and checking so it ends up like a thick cake batter
You can add in stuff like seeds now if you like
Beat 2 egg whites til stiff, fold through batter
Pour into tin
Let sit overnight, covered but not so that the batter will touch when it rises
Bake in the oven like normal sourdough bread - first half covered and second half uncovered.
