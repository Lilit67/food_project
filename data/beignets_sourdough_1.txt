I was kinda of winging it.... but here is the recipe I used:
1 1/2-2 cups warm milk
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup butter
1 cup fed active starter
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking powder.
5-6 cups ap flour

I brought all of the ingredients together in my mixer. Don’t overwork. Refrigerate over night

This makes A LOT, so I divided the dough in thirds and rolled to 1/4” thick. Cut into 2”-2” squares and fries in 375 degree oil. Turning when Brown. Dust with powdered sugar.

I think the amount of milk will differ depending upon the day and humidity. The dough was quite sticky. My measurements were approx because I kept adjusting to get the right consistency.
