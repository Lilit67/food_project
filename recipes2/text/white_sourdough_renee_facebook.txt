My Sourdough All White formula--makes two small loaves or one medium-large loaf:
Day 1:
Poolish--80 gm water, 80 gm flour, 20 gm of a starter fed the night before and very active. Mix all. Cover. Rest 10 to 12 hrs--overnight at room temperature.
Day 2:
160 gm AP flour, 160 gm bread flour, 228 gm water, 8 gm salt, 20 gm starter fed the night before--must be very strong--, and all of the poolish. Mix by hand or with mixer just until it comes together to form a shaggy mass. It will be very sticky.
Rest covered one hour. Stretch and fold every 30 minutes 4 times. Rest until dough has small, medium, and maybe one or two larger bubbles; and dough nearly doubles in size, is domed, and jiggles when container is agitated. This can take 2 to 6 hrs depending on how warm your kitchen is. Do not rush the BF.
Divide dough or keep as one mass. Pre-shape. Rest 30 mins-covered.
Do final shaping and place in rice floured bannetons, whatever you use, bowls with kitchen towels are great.
This can be baked after proofing about an hour at room temp. Do poke test every 20 mins, just in case.
About 30 mins before you are ready to bake preheat stone or vessel with lid or pot to cover-if using stone-to 470 F.
Use parchment over basket and invert dough. Slash, spray with water. Put on stone or in pot. Cover. Bake 30 mins. Remove lid or pot if it's baking on stone. Continue baking another 10 or 15 mins.
These loaves are ridiculously light. Don't drop the loaf when you remove it from the oven!!
If wanting to bake another day, proof just 20 mins at room temp. Put basket in a plastic bag and refrigerate 12 to 48 hrs. Preheat vessel to 450 F. 30 mins later place cold dough straight from the fridge in the pot or on the stone and score and cover...
The oven spring is outrageous on these. Try it!
