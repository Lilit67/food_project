Using a “fallen” starter at room temp is more about the risk of introducing acidity into the loaf, versus a material difference in yeast strength, in my opinion.
The peak yeast population occurs in the starter 1-2 hours after the starter peaks in height. Every hour after this time, the yeast strength is slightly deteriorating, but more importantly, the acidity of the starter continues growing.
If my starter is past-peak I always look at it and smell it to see if it seems too acidic. If it has really fallen and smells acidic but I need to use it, I will do a top-off feeding (about 1/3 of normal feeding) and give it a few hours to start to show activity. This reactivates the yeast and slightly dilutes the acidity. (This approach is recommended in C. Robertson’s “Tartine Bread.”)
If you don’t have a problem with overproofed loaves a lot of people will recommend just using the past-peak starter. It may take a little longer to ferment/proof but will eventually rise the loaf.

That is great information. I will try the top off feeding next time I am faced with that situation. Last time, my guy had already done a regular feeding when I arrived. We waited a few hours and used it but the loaves had very little strength and we ended up not using them. My intuition would have been to use the unfed starter since the mix would be feeding it but I like your suggestion better. Thank you.

Look at it. If it has not fallen yet, use it. I started 3x day feedings 20 years ago but eventually dropped to one feeding in the evening. I used a stiff starter, so it remains at peak strength much longer.
