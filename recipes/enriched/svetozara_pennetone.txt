I totally forgot to mix the salt into this sweet dough but (or probably because of this omission) it turned out pretty well ðŸ™‚ Actually I fell in love with these airy and light as a feather dough cubes ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©
Hereâ€™s the recipe:
For the preferment:
âž¢ 180 g active starter at 100% hydration
âž¢ 200 g manitoba or other strong flour
âž¢ 100 g whole milk
âž¢ 40 g sugar
Mix well, proof until quadrupled (about 6 hours at 28 degrees).
For the main dough:
âž¢ 6 eggs (about 320 g)
âž¢ 260 g sugar
âž¢ 140 g whole milk
âž¢ 80 g butter
âž¢ 80 g sunflower oil
âž¢ 740 g manitoba or other strong flour
âž¢ 2 g salt
âž¢ 2 tbsp vanilla extract, fresh lemon zest, lemon extract
Combine the eggs, sugar, milk and the whole preferment in the bowl of a stand mixer. After mixing for a few minutes add the salt. Start adding in flour spoon by spoon and mix until it comes together into a soft, sticky dough, about 20 minutes. You should be able to stretch the dough out fairly thin without it breaking (the windowpane test). If it breaks, mix it for a couple more minutes.
At this point start adding in the oil followed by butter, piece by piece, and mix to incorporate for another 20-30 minutes until the dough is shiny and elastic.
Turn out the dough into an buttered bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let proof for about 8-10 hours at 25-26 degrees C or until dough has more than tripled in size.
Shape and let proof for another 4 hours at 27-28 degrees C or until it has doubled in size.
Brush the top of the bread with egg wash. Bake in preheated oven to 180 degrees C and for about 30-35 minutes or until the top is dark golden brown.
