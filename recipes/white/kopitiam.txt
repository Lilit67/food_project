all sourdough kopitiam bread
i thought i should share this with fellow sourdough enthusiasts. kopitiam bread is a very popular bread in spore & malaysia...
recipe (under tropical environment)
260 gm bread flour
130 gm active SD starter
20 gm caster sugar
1 tsp salt
130 gm water
20 gm olive oil
(note: total bread flour 325 gm)
method
put all ingredients into a stand mixer bowl & knead at speed 2, until the dough comes together.
remove from bowl, shape into a ball & let the dough rest for 15 minutes, to relax the gluten.
shape & place in a 8x4x4.5‚Äù pullman pan or equivalent.
cover pan with cling film & let it proof until the dough touches the film.
fire up the oven at 190C, and when ready, load the pan into the oven and bake for 35-40 minutes.
happy baking.
tip. you can let the dough rise higher, if you want a fluffier loaf üò¨
for slower fermentation, adjust % of starter accordingly
