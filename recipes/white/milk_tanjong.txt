Sourdough tangzhong milk bread
Tangzhong
50g bread flour
125ml milk
125ml water
Cooked on the stove until thick.
When the tangzhong is cool, add
110g sugar
2 eggs
63g milk
14g milk powder
10g salt
60g unsalted butter( I also use coconut or olive oil with great results)
400g very active starter 100% hydration. (mine triples in 4 hours)
500g bread flour
I use a Kitchenaid mixer for about 10 mins. Can also be manually kneaded using slap and fold on the counter.
Let rise until doubled, 3-4 hours.
Shaped and let rise again until tripled in volume, 3-4 hours before baking at 175Â°F for 45 mins.
*I use a lot of starter so I can bake the same day. I prefer this bread with very little tang.
Rising times will depend on how active your starter and ambient temperature.
