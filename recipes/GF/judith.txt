t has been decades since I first started glutenfree baking, out of necessity. Coming from a traditional family of home baker women, my knowledge stems from my roots and experience. I have never asked others, but myself and my dough. My recipes are results of hard work and tremendous amount of time and sacrifices. This has became my profession too, so I am actually not just sharing my recipe, but my bread, my living, and that of my family's. But in the world of today, I feel its the right thing to do, and I hope it helps others.
However, ehen you use or share it, when it inspires you to just change one ingredient and show it to others, do that with respect and name the origin. Remember, I shared myself.

THE RECIPE

For the pre-dough:
220 ml of water
1 tsp / 10 g honey
80-150 g of active sourdough
190 g (30 g almonds, 50 g brown rice flour, 50 g millet, 60 g buckwheat + 1 tsp flax flour or 50 g oatmeal flour, 50 g millet, 50 g rice flour, 40 g buckwheat + 1 tsp flax flour) Stir well and place in a lidded dish into the microwave or the oven with a glass of hot water (this creates a steamy warm environment). After about 3 hours add the following: 110 g flour (millet, sorghum, brown rice, buckwheat or oatmeal, teff, rice)
1 tbsp / 15 g potato flour
25 g of psyllium husk
200-220 ml water (flour dependent)
1 tbsp shortening (I always use duck fat) 1 tsp / 6-8 g salt
Pinch of cumin and nutmeg (Optional) Stir the ingredients vigorously for 10 minutes (ideally with an electric mixer) and leave it to stand for 30 minutes. Then, on a floured surface, knead and shape as preferred. For those with less experience, I recommend a sandwich tin. Let it rise for 1-1.5 hours (depending on temperature). Bake in a 220 degree oven for 25-30 minutes, then open and close the oven door to vent, return the temperature to 200 degrees and bake for an additional 40-45 minutes.
