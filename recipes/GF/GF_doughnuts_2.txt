Gluten free baked yeasted doughnuts/stuffed sweet buns
75g powdered milk (can be coconut milk powder)
170g white rice flour
30g GF oat flour or brown rice flour
120g potato starch
100g tapioca starch
15g psyllium husk powder
7g xanthan
250ml milk (or vegan replacement)
150g plain yogurt (or vegan yogurt)
6g salt
70g sugar (can be more if you like more sweet bakes)
15g fresh yeast or 5g instant yeast
2 eggs (or vegan replacement)
60g melted butter (or plant shortening)
15g fresh yeast, 20g rice flour and 20ml milk mixed and left for 30 mins (this step can be omitted if you use instant rapid rise yeast)
Mixed all well together in a stand mixer Left for 1hr in warm place
Rolled out (just with hands) and shaped doughnuts/buns (the dough is very wet and sticky, sprinkle it well with rice flour and carefully make shape on your preference). You can stuff the buns with marmalade, chocolate etc before you bake them, but it is not an easy task. The buns can be filled in as well after baking.
Left them again for 20-30 mins to raise. Before baking mine were brushed with an egg stirred with some milk. Baked in 220C for 25 mins (or you can fry them in hot oil or lard (180C))
