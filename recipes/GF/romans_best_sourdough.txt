Romanâ€™s Best GF Sourdough Bread ðŸ˜„
Ingredients:
100g active starter (in my case buckwheat-oat)
400g of homemade flour blend (mine was 50g teff flour, 50 white rice flour, 100g brown rice flour, 50g maize flour, 50g chestnut flour, 50g potato starch, 50g corn starch, you can use your own composition)
450-500g water
20g rice syrup (or agave syrup, honey, maple syrup, date syrup, etc.)
20g vegetable oil (or melted butter or other fat)
13g salt
10g grind flax (flax meal)
20g psyllium husk powder
You need two bowls (or other containers) to prepare the dough.
Prepare you flours blend, mix all flours and starches well together.
Autolyse bowl
150g water
150g flour blend
20g of oil or other liquid fat
(Optionally you can add some seeds and soak them together with flours, here I took some sesame and hemp seeds)
Mix all well together and leave to rest
Fermentolyse bowl
100g starter
250g water
250g flour blend
20g syrup
10g flax meal
Mix all well and leave to rest
You donâ€™t need to use any mixer or other kitchen aids, it is quite easy to mix all by hand.
Both bowls leave to rest for 2-4hrs depending on your room temperature. The warmer, the shorter the time. Iâ€™ve kept both batters for 2,5 hrs.
When you see small bubbles in the fermentolyse bowl it is time to mix both batters together.
Add 13g salt and mix again.
Add then 20g psyllium husk powder, knead the dough and leave on a counter for 45 min
Add 50-100g water and knead the dough again.
Shape the loaf and proof in the fridge for 8hrs (or longer if you want to leave it overnight)
Bake in the well preheated DO in 240C 30min with the lid, and then another 20-30min 230 C without cover
