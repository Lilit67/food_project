If you are fed up with the flour mixes found in the store, know that you can very easily
 make your own mixes. This will allow you to make your own mixtures according to your needs and tastes!

I admit that, for my part, I make my mixes on the fly,
based on the inspiration of the moment and my needs. Therefore I don't have a Mixer but a multitude of
 flour packets stored in a dedicated cupboard. I do indeed have a hard time with frozen things ...

But following your requests for comments on my Facebook page, I decided to sacrifice myself !!
Here is a list of “Home Made” Mixes that you can use:

1 - THE “HOME MADE” MIX
