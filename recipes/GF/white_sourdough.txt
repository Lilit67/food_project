900 ml water
2 tablespoons of gluten free sourdough (check how to make one in previous posts 👇🏻)
1 tsp honey (or maple syrup for vegan version)
35 g psyllium husk
3 tsp sea salt (use about half if you use white table salt)
1/2 tsp ground cardamom
1/4 tsp ground coriander
450 g gluten free flour (I used 150 g millet flour, 150 g sorghum flour and 150 g corn meal)
Mix it all together, and let it mix for about 20 minutes in a standing mixer.
Cover and let it rise in a cool place for about 8 hours. (Or pop it in the fridge and take it out 1-2 hours before baking)

Bake at 220 degrees Celsius for about 35-38 minutes, til the crust is nice and firm.

If you want to bake bread instead of buns, divide the dough in two, dust with flour, score and bake for about 1 hour and 10 minutes till the crust is nice and firm.

You can use both powdered psyllium, or the coarser variety. We use the coarser variety! Maybe it’s the one called whole in the US?
