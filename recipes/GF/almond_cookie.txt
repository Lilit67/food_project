This cookie recipe is very unusual!
Why? Because taste is amazing and it brings these childhood memories! It is big, glossy and has a very chewy center! I love it!

You will need:

150g(1cup) raw almonds
300g(1½ cup) super fine sugar
40g(1/3cup) flour
125g(4 egg whites)
1 tsp almond extract

Grind almonds into coarse meal.
Combine with sugar.
Add egg whites, mix into an almond paste.
Boil a pot of water with opening so your mixing bowl will fit into it.
Put mixing bowl with almond paste on a double boiler and mix it until sugar dissolved, mixture becomes thinner and warm to touch.
Take it off the double boiler, add almond extract and let cool for 5 min.

Sift flour in and mix until smooth.

Transfer your dough into a piping bag and pipe out medium size cookies on a lined baking sheet far apart.

Bake in preheated to 320°F(160°C) oven for 20-25 min.
You will see your cookies will start to crack which is normal.

Let them cool completely on a baking sheet.
