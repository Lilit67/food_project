This is my welcome post in this group ğŸ‘‹ ğŸ˜Š
Let me share with you my recent "experiment", still not completely chilled ğŸ”ªğŸ”ª
200g active teff starter
300 g water
20g oil
20g agave sirup (or honey)
300 g water
12g salt
Mixed well in a bowl
added
100g teff flour
20g oat flour
80g white rice flour
50g light buckwheat flour
50g potato starch
50g corn starch
Mixed again and left for 30 min
Then added
20g flax flour and 50g water
stired and left for another 30 min
added 20g psyllium husk powder, kneaded the dough left for 45 min ğŸ˜‰
finally added 50g milk kefir (can be just water), kneaded again formed a loaf and put into a tin pan.
Kept on a counter for about 2 hrs and then put into the fridge (for about 10 hrs)
In the morning decorated with sesame seeds and poppy seeds. Preheated oven to 240C, then reduced temp. to 220C and baked 30min, took out from the pan and baked another 20min in 220C.
The crumb is spongy, dry, not gummy at all. I think still more water (about 50g more, my starter was quite stiff) could be given to get more holes ğŸ˜‰. I'll definitely go for next attempt (all in one day and more water :))
