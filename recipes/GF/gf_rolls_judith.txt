Simple bread rolls #gumfree #starchfree
(based on my basic bread recipe)
100% 250 g flour (I used a mixture of brown rice, light teff, buckwheat)
15 % 40 g (1:3:3 hydration) starter (about 2-3 tbsp)
120-140% 300-350 ml water depending on your choice of flour
8% 20 g psyllium (about 3 tbsp) or add 15 g psyllium and 5 g golden linseed
2% 5 g salt
2% 5 g shortening
1. Feed your starter the evening before baking
2. In the morning mix water(start with 280 g and gradually add the rest), flour and starter, cover and rest for 3 hours (YOUNG LEVAIN)
3. Add in the other ingredients, knead well and rest for 30 minutes.
4. Shape, place on lined baking tray and prove for 4-8 hours.
4. Bake for 30-40 minutes in 220 degrees C preheated oven. Cool fully before cutting.
Notes:
--- You can also prove in bulk and shape after proving, howewer, when not handled carefully this method might deflates the dough.
---- if so desired, brush the proven rolls with water and coat with mixed seeds.
