Improved Banana Bread
by Javier Tan June-10-2018

This improved Banana Bread is a perfect breakfast and tea item, for anyone and everyone! Note that a hand mixer will make this recipe even simpler!

Ingredients

1 and 3/4 Cups or 200g All Purpose Flour, Sifted unless using a mixer.
1/2 Cup + 2 Tablespoons or 125g White Sugar
1 Teaspoon or 6g Baking Soda
1/4 Teaspoon or 1.4g Table Salt
1/2 Cup or 115g Unsalted Butter, Melted and Cooled
2 Large Egg, each weiging 55 to 60g, at room temperature
1/3 Cup or 80ml Milk, at room temperature
2.5ml or 1/2 Teaspoon Vanilla Extract
2 Medium Large Bananas, Mashed, total about 180g or slightly more than 1/2 cup
1/8 Teaspoon or a pinch of Cinnamon.
1 Cup of Nuts of your choice ( I am using almonds, which is about 140g, chopped according to how you like it! )
Instructions

Preheat your oven to 180 degrees C and line your loaf pan with parchment paper, leaving overhangs. I am using a 9 x 5 inches loaf pan.
Mix together the melted butter with the sugar until the sugar has dissolved.
Add in the two eggs and mix well.
Add in the vanilla extract, baking soda, salt and cinnamon and stir well.
Add in the mashed bananas and milk and stir until well incorporated ( a single uniform mixture is formed ).
Add in the sifted all purpose flour and the nuts and stir well until the flour has just dissolved.
Pour into your loaf pan and tap against the counter a few times to even out the mixture and to get rid of excess air.
Bake at 180 degrees C for about 50-55 minutes or until nicely golden brown where a toothpick inserted into the center will come out clean.

Notes:

You can add an additional banana if you like a stronger taste.
Can be kept at room temperature in an airtight container for up to 3 days. I am using a ziploc bag to ensure that it is absolutely airtight.
Sifting is not required if you are using a hand mixer!
