Basically mix everything together, best if you have a mixer since this dough is extremely sticky. I don’t own one, so a few stretches and folds would do this dough good. I did 3 with about 30 mins intervals. Then rounded it up to a ball to rest in the fridge overnight to develop flavor. The next day i let it go to room temp for about an hour or two, shaped in a greased pan until doubled.. it should surpass your 13” pan by half an inch. It took about 4-5 hours. Baked at 425f for 15mins, then 350f for 25 mins. 😋 ——
Edit: Swap the Honey with Agave or your choice of vegan syrup, and the butter with Vegan butter blend. 😅 I personally haven’t tried that one but it sounds promising!
