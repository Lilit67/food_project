Ingredients
10 servings
For the starter:
2 tablespoons (35 grams/1.2 ounces) very active, fully fermented firm sourdough starter, refreshed 8 to 12 hours earlier
1/3 cup (80 grams/2.8 ounces) warm water
About 1 cup (135 grams/4.8 ounces) bread flour
For final dough:
1/4 cup (60 grams/2 ounces) warm water
3 large eggs, plus 1 for glazing
1 1/2 teaspoons (8 grams/0.3 ounce) table salt
1/4 cup (55 grams/1.9 ounces) vegetable oil
3 tablespoons (65 grams/2.3 ounces) mild honey or a scant 1/3 cup (60 grams/2.1 ounces) granulated sugar
About 3 cups (400 grams/14 ounces) bread flour
Fully fermented sourdough starter

In the Morning: mixing the sourdough starter: Knead starter into water
until it is partially dissolved, then stir in the flour. Knead until it is smooth.
Let the starter ferment until it has tripled in volume and is just starting to deflate.
 (It took me 3hr in room temperature at 30oC - 4 times its volume).
  If it is winter, you should do it in the evening and it takes more time to rise.
