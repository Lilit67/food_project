400g semola flour
1.5 tsp dry yeast
1 tsp sugar
1.5 cup water (semola flour tends to take more water than usual flour) pinch of salt (I dissolve it in the water)
1 tbsp olive oil

Work the dough in a mixer for about 10 minutes. If the dough is too dry as a bit more water, if too wet, add a bit of all purpose flour (helps bind the dough)
The dough should be elastic but a bit wet and sticky.
Let it rise in an oiled bowl for about 2 hours, folding the dough every 30 minutes.
The dough should double in size
Shape the dough and let rise for another 30 minutes
Bake in a preheated oven (215c) for 10 minutes than reduced the heat for 190 for another 25-30 minutes. my oven has steam function which I use on low to help the dough rise and cook.
Hope youâ€™ll have a good bake!
