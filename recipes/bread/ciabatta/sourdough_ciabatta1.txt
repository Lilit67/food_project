The sourdough ciabatta rolls are almost done. ❤️
This is adapted from a formula by a member of another SD group - Anne Wagner.
with my changes:
Prepare a biga/preferment- 120 g of starter straight out of the fridge.
120 g of room temp water
200 grams of bread flour.
Hand mix and then let this sit on a warm counter for 4-6 hrs.
Dough:
Stir together
240 grams warm water
6 grams (~1 tsp) sea salt
Gently stir in the preferment.
Add 300 g all purpose flour and mix thoroughly
Drizzle a tablespoon or two of olive oil in a container.  I use a rectangular Cambro container.
Cover let sit in a warm place or in a proofer. I used the Proof setting on my oven but I also have a Brod and Taylor. Depending on how healthy your starter is, let dough double.  Mine took about 6 hours in a room that is about 72-75 deg F.
Do a very gentle stretch n fold with a wet hand every hour or so.  Olive oil will get worked into dough in this process.  That is ok. Heavily flour your surface and turn your container over and allow your dough to release onto the flour. This helps it keep its rectangular shape.
Gently flatten dough and cut into 8 rolls. I placed them in a well floured couche. I use a shaker to sprinkle flour on top of rolls then gently cover them to rest while oven preheats.
Preheat oven with a baking stone to 450 deg for 45 min before baking.  Transfer rolls gently to a rimless baking sheet topped with parchment paper sprinkled with semolina. I use the baking sheet to transfer the rolls and parchment onto the stone. I put a cast iron skillet on the bottom shelf and poured in a cup of boiling water when I put my rolls in to create some steam. LAY A TOWEL OVER YOUR OVEN DOOR GLASS TO PROTECT IT. IF YOU SPILL WATER ON THE GLASS IT WILL SHATTER.
Bake about 18-20 min. Cool on a rack.
