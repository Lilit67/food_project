My current matnakash

180 g bread
70 g AP
170 g water
2 tbs olive oil
8 g salt
100g starter

65% to 75 % hydration

mix, autolyse, add salt, SF for 2 hours
lay flat, leave to bulk raise for 4 hours 75 F
add olive oil on surface, punch with fingers
bake in preheated to 450 F oven for 20 min

for matnakash, no sugar
