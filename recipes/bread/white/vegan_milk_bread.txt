400g Coconut cream, You can use your choice of Plant beverage, either Almond or Oat. (67%)

To get a more evenly distributed and aerated crumb, this was bulked for 5hrs with 4 coil folds separated by an hour.
Then shaped directly in pan, Slightly degassing.

then chilled and retarded for around 5-6hours until i took it out to proof again on the counter while i slept,
dough temp was around 45F and rose half an inch above the pan for 7-8hrs.
 If you’re afraid of over-proofing while you sleep,
 i suggest to just keep it in the fridge til next morning,
 and wait for it to rise. I was at the verge of severely over-proofing these.
  But i find the texture of almost over-proofed loaves to be very springy and soft..
  so it’s still a win! These are very tangy because of the Long proof and Liquid levain,
  as i’ve said stick to stiff starters if you want a less acidic loaf.
  I baked this for 25 mins at 420F then another 25 for 370F.
  Lightly Wrapped in foil to soften the crust, and preserve moisture. Enjoy!
