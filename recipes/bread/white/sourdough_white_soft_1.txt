Sourdough White Bread.
I love soft version rather than the rustic one. Very pleased with the crumbs especially for the beginner like me 😁
I found the recipe from @artijorgenson instagram, so here's the recipe
Ingredients :
80 gr sourdough starter 100%hydration
20 gr milk powder
60 gr sugar
210 gr water
400 gr bread flour
4 gr salt
50 gr softened butter

Mix and knead sourdough, milk powder, sugar, water, bread flour until mostly smooth. Add in salt and butter, knead until you get window pane stage. Bulk ferment about 1 hour (I lived in tropical area) continue chill in the fridge about 12 hours.
Shape and proofing about 6-8 hours or until the dough reached 90% height of loaf pan (20 x 10 cm).
Bake and enjoy the bread 😁
