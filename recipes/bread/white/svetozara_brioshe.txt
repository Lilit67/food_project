Naturally leavened brioche dough and 5 different ways to shape it ðŸ¤©
Brioche dough
â€¢ 280 grams white flour
â€¢ 190 grams strong flour
â€¢ 185 grams eggs
â€¢ 150 grams milk
â€¢ 5 grams salt
â€¢ 50 grams sugar
â€¢ 100 grams sourdough starter at 100% hydration
â€¢ 160 grams butter softened
â€¢ Egg for washing
Mix the flours, eggs, milk, sugar, salt and sourdough starter in stand mixer. Add the butter and continue to mix, scraping down the boil periodically to ensure butter is thoroughly incorporated. The dough will be very soft. Move dough into a greased bowl, cover and leave in a cold room (approximately 16c/60F) overnight or until tripled in volume.
Method for Hamburger Buns:
Move the dough to a lightly buttered surface, divide into approximately 80 gram portions. Shape each piece into a smooth ball. Put the rolls on a baking tray and flatten them slightly to form into a burger bun shape. Cover with plastic wrap and leave to proof for 3-4 hours or until they are more than doubled in volume. Pre-heat oven to 190C/375F. Brush the top of the buns with an egg wash and sprinkle with desired seeds. Bake for approximately 20 minutes or until evenly browned.
Method for Croissants:
Mix the dough as instructed above except divide the dough into 2 equal pieces instead of 80gram rolls. Shape each piece into a smooth ball and leave for 15 minutes. Roll out the dough using a rolling pin. Cut and shape the croissants using your favorite filling. Put them in a baking tray, cover with clean plastic wrap and leave to proof at cool room temperature for 3-4 hours or until they double in volume. Pre-heat the oven to 190C/375F. Brush the top of the croissants with an egg wash. Bake for 20 minutes or until evenly browned.
