Երեվանյան պոնչիկներ
Dough:
1 kg of all purpose flour
25 gr of fresh yeast or 1 tbsp of dried yeast
3 tbsp of sugar
2 tbsp of brandy or cognac
3 tbsp vegetable oil
1 tsp of salt
1 egg
2-2.5 cups of warm water or milk
Make the dough with all ingredients at once and store in the warm place to rise. Meanwhile, make the filling.
Filling:
1 egg
1 cup of sugar
3 tbsp of flour
Vanilla per taste
*Note: The original recipe doesn’t have it but I added about 50-70 gr of butter to enrich the taste . It us optional.
Mix the ingredients well making sure there are no lumps. Cook on medium low heat stirring constantly until thickens. At this point I added the butter and mixed until melted. Cool the filling to room temperature.
When the dough doubled in size, knead it down and divide into egg-sized balls (about 24). Flatten a ball on floured surface trying to keep the round shape, put a teaspoon or slightly more of the filling in the centre, collect the ends, and press them together forming a ball with the filling inside, then turn upside down, slightly and carefully flatten and shape into rounds. Put aside on floured surface until all of them are ready.
Fry in vegetable oil on medium heat. Place on paper towels and sprinkle sugar powder on it.
You can make them smaller, they rise quite a bit. But I liked them large, just like I remember them from Ponchukanots in Yerevan.
Enjoy!
